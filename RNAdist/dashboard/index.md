In the Navbar at the top you can find and Input field to set your session token. Everything you compute here will be
stored using this token. If you want to access your data later store your token somewhere.

Note that data will be stored no longer than 7 days and there is the possibility that it gets deleted even earlier 
depending on website traffic. Further all our jobs will be public. Meaning everyone that knows your token can access it.
